# ESP32 Integrated Control Interface for Factory Diversion

This project is a Next.js application designed for controlling LED sequences with an ESP32 microcontroller. The application features a customizable number of ports and LEDs per port, draggable and resizable settings panels, and generates FastLED code for programming the ESP32.

## Features

- Define the number of ports and the number of LEDs per port.
- Resizable and draggable settings panels.
- Custom color system with gold and blue gradients.
- Side Panel:
  - Create custom operation sequences.
  - Drag and drop LEDs to form lighting patterns.
  - Generate ready-to-use FastLED code.
- Advanced Features:
  - Auto-update code with every modification.
  - Full support for the Arabic language.
  - Responsive design for all screen sizes.

## FastLED Integration

- Generate pre-configured codes for programming.
- Support various lighting patterns.
- Assign specific colors to each LED.

## Possible Enhancements

- Advanced motion effects.
- Predefined lighting patterns.
- Remote control via WiFi.
- Save/load configurations.
- Live preview of patterns.
